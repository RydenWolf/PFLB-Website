# PFLB-Website
A basic website using many things such as flask and django. Database used in areas such as user login and user data.

This website has used a lot of python packages that will be required to run it. I cannot exactly remember all of them but it is pretty self explantatory.
To run the website open up your terminal or windows command prompt (depending or your OS) and run the command 
-> python .../PFLB-Redo/main.py
where the ... is replaced with the directory of the PFLB-Redo file.
This will start a server running on the ip 127.0.0.1:5000 where if you type that into your browser while it is running the website will show.

If you encounter any problems running or accessing the code let me know.
